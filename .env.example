# HOW TO GET THESE VALUES:
#
# 1. Go to https://sentry.io and sign in (or create an account)
# 2. Create a new project: Settings > Projects > Create Project
#    - Select "React" as the platform
#    - Name it (e.g., "webmcp-playground")
# 3. After creating the project, you'll see the DSN on the setup page
#    - Or find it later: Settings > Projects > [your project] > Client Keys (DSN)
#

# VITE_SENTRY_DSN - Required for Sentry to work

# =============================================================================
# Source Map Upload (CI/CD only - keep secret!)
# =============================================================================
#
# For better error stack traces in Sentry, upload source maps during CI/CD:
# 1. Go to: Settings > Auth Tokens > Create New Token
# 2. Select scopes: project:releases, org:read
#
# Set these as secrets in your CI/CD environment (GitHub Actions, etc.)
# DO NOT commit actual values!
#
# SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_...
# SENTRY_ORG and SENTRY_PROJECT are set in wrangler.json
